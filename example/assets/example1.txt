Feature: Support internationalisation
  As a polyglot coffee lover
  I can select the language on the coffee machine
  So I can practice my use of greetings in several languages

  Scenario: No messages are displayed when machine is shut down
    Given the coffee machine is started
    When I shutdown the coffee machine
    Then message "Bye" should be displayed

  Scenario Outline: Messages are based on language
    # Well, sometimes, you just get a coffee.
    When I start the coffee machine using language <language>
    Then message <ready_message> should be displayed

    Examples:
      | language   | ready_message |
      | en         | Ready         |
      | fr         | Pret          |
